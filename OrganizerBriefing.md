# Los Angeles Field Day

## January 2018

[Field Day Website](http://githubfieldday.com/la2018/)

**Field Day is a one day unconference for leaders of technical student communities.** It brings together leaders from different regional communities to hang out, become friends, learn from each other's mistakes and successes, and solve shared problems.

## Motivation
Separate communities frequently co-exist in a shared region. They know of each other, but they don't collaborate or talk to each other much. If they do, they would benefit from doing it even more.

Their relationship tends to be underdeveloped for the following reasons:
- Members of each communities' committee/organizing team don't know each other
- They don't frequently communicate. Unlike their peers in their own community, they don't see each other in classes every day.
- Kicking off, and then sustaining inter-community collaboration efforts is a hard task.
- There is not enough opportunity to maintain inter-community friendships over time.

Field Day can help improve some of these problems. At the very fundamental level it represents a place for student leaders across communities to spend time together, which will improve their relationships.

### What's an unconference?
To quote the google definition:
> A loosely structured conference emphasizing the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants

There are two key points to what an unconference is in the context of Field Day:
1. It's (largely) unstructured. Topics of discussion can be decided on the day.
2. The content itself is decided and provided by the attendees on the day.

There are two reasons why the unconference format works well for Field Day:
1. Since attendees decide the content, it is timely, relevant, and represents what they want to talk about.
2. This rather loose structure carries a much smaller organizational burden than a full conference.

## Who can attend Field Day?
Field Day is for student leaders of technical communities in the Los Angeles area.

A student leader is someone who's actively involved in improving their local technical community. They might be the president or chairperson of their school's tech club or be one of the organizers of the annual hackathon. They might run the student hardware group or be actively involved in introducing other students to programming.

## Schedule (still TBD)
![Schedule from Beta Field Day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7718702/28942522-a3e5b352-7869-11e7-8206-d7746a45c133.png)
The picture above shows our schedule for Beta Field Day. You're of course free to adjust this based on what works best in the region. Basic building blocks that should be included:
- There should be a "Welcome from GitHub" slot at the beginning (This will be delivered by the Campus Rep)
- There should be an icebreaker session at the beginning
- The majority of Field Day should be in the unconference format (breakout discussions & lightning talks)

## Attending Field Day
Expecting an attendance of 60-70 students. Options to filter the students is through an application process, or giving tickets to the leadership of each community and letting them distribute/choose.

Students will be given Lyft codes (~$20-25) for transportation.

## Venue - What is required?
- One large space where everyone can sit (for welcome session, keynote, etc.)
  - This should have AV equipment (microphone, speakers, projector)
- Breakout spaces (to facilitate discussions)
  - 1 breakout space per 25 expected attendees
  - large space for everyone can be a breakout space too
  - Each space should have a whiteboard and ideally a projector/TV
- Space for "Learn about Campus Experts" lounge (this consists of a few couches, a coffee table, and some standup posters)
- Whiteboard for discussion matrix

## Time Commitment
Being on the organizing team:
- Meetings not necessary at the early planning stages, as long as there is weekly check ups. May need meetings when the event gets closer.
- Shouldn't be a heavy workload, once a venue and date are booked.

## Responsibilities
- Booking a venue
- Confirming a date
- Pushing to social media
- Confirming RSVP'd attendees 
- Ordering food, swag, miscellaneous
- Transportation (Lyft/Uber) codes
- Finding a keynote speaker

## Finances
All money will be covered by GitHub. No need to front anything.

GitHub will provide 100 USD per expected attendee. I'm expecting 60-70 attendees (which is dependent on the size of the venue), so I'll have access to $6000-7000.
