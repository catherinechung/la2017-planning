# la2017-planning

# When?
Early January seems to be the best option. Originally, it was discussed to hold the event in early November, but that seems rushed for planning and collides with the exam schedule for California schools.

# Where?
On a college campus. Looking into venue spaces at UCLA since USC is a small campus and doesn't have big enough spaces.

# Size
60-75 students

# Collaborators
Currently talking to technical student leaders from UCLA and Caltech.
